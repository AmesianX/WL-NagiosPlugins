Hi there,

This is a public code repository for nagios plugins I've been writing since 2004.
Most of these plugins have been available on my site, on nagios exchange and
on monitoring exchange for years. If you need more information please see:
  http://william.leibzon.org/nagios/

On nagios exchange plugins and graphing templates can be found at:
  http://exchange.nagios.org/directory/Owner/willix/1

Each plugin has its own "README" and HELP in the header section before the code.
All plugins are released under GPL 2.0 License as specified in that header too.

While I'll continue to accept patches by email as before, if you use git
I'll be happy to accept your contributions by pull requests too.

If you need to reach me, email to: william@leibzon.org

Thanks for reading and using my plugins,

William
