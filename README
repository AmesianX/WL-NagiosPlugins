Hi there,

This is a public code repository for nagios plugins I've been writing since 2004.
Most of the plugins have been available on my site, nagios exchange and
monitoring exchange for years. If you need more information please see:
  http://william.leibzon.org/nagios/

Each plugin has its own "README" in the header section of the plugin.

While I'll continue to accept patches by email as before, if you do know
how to use git, I'll be happy to accept your contribution by pull request too.

If you need to reach me, email to: william@leibzon.org

Thanks for reading and using my plugins,

William
